# __NEXT__


# 1.3.0 (9 August 2018)

## Features

* The `update` command now prunes old Docker images after downloading new ones.
  This functionality relies on our new, labeled images.  Older images will have
  to be manually pruned as a one-time step.  See `docker image prune` for more
  information.  Note that locally built images which are tagged
  nextstrain/base:latest will be pruned when `update` is run.  Protect such
  images by giving them an additional tag.

* The versions of the Docker image and individual Nextstrain components in the
  image are shown when the `version` command is run with the `--verbose` flag.


# 1.2.0 (1 August 2018)

## Features

* A new `deploy` command supports uploading data files to S3, allowing the
  complete pathogen build lifecycle to happen using this package.

* The `check-setup` and `update` commands now check if the CLI itself is out of
  date and could be updated.

## Documentation

* Brief descriptions of the changes in each release are now kept in the
  `CHANGES.md` file.  You're reading it!

## Development

* Describe basic development practices for this package in the README.

* Commit to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org), which I'd been
  neglecting previously when bumping versions.

* Static type checking is now supported for a small fraction of the source code
  and runs clean under mypy.  This is included in Travis CI testing.  The goal
  is to add more type annotations going forward.
